## Influence Maximization Problem

### Algorithm

Implement algorithm described in “Influence Maximization in Near-Linear Time: A Martingale Approach” 

### Usage

```shell
$ python3 IMP.py -i <graph file path> -k <the number of seeds> -m <IC or LT> -t <termination time> 
```

### Result

NetHept Dataset：

e = 0.1 l = 1 seed_num = 50 

Output (estimated diffusion)：1294-1298

Time(8 processes): 3.5s
